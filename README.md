# S_python_software_example
This is a basic example of an external software pluggable to the Cytomine platform.

This python script was used as an example into our documentation on *How to integrate an external software into Cytomine*.
You can still use it as an example by following our new documentation about [Cytomine apps](https://doc.cytomine.org/dev-guide/algorithms/)

It contains the descriptor, the Dockerfile and the script itself.
